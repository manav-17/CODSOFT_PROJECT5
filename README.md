CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

AIM - Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 

TECHNOLOGIES - 

a.Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is used to read the credit card dataset from a CSV file, check for missing values, and manipulate the dataset.

b.NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python, often used for array operations. Although it's not explicitly used in your code, it is utilized behind the scenes by libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.

c.Scikit-learn (sklearn): A widely used machine learning library in Python. The following components from Scikit-learn are utilized in your code:

1.train_test_split: A function that splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

2.StandardScaler: A preprocessing method used to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance, which is important for algorithms like logistic regression.

3.LogisticRegression: A machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

4.classification_report and confusion_matrix: Functions to evaluate the performance of the model on the test dataset.

d.Imbalanced-learn (imblearn): A library that provides tools to deal with imbalanced datasets. In your code, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the classes in the dataset by generating synthetic samples of the minority class, which is essential for improving model performance in cases of class imbalance.

e.Machine Learning: The code demonstrates a typical workflow for a binary classification task, specifically using logistic regression to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

f.Data Preprocessing: The code includes data preprocessing steps, such as scaling the features using StandardScaler and applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance before training the model.

g.Model Evaluation Metrics: The use of confusion matrix and classification report to assess the performance of the model is part of the evaluation phase in machine learning, providing insights into model accuracy and effectiveness.
